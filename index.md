## Introduction

Devil's Canyon is a simple application that is used to show how WearML can be used to optimize an Android App for a HMT-1 device.

The application consists of a single screen containing 3 logos showing some delicious beers. Selecting each logo will show a short description about each beer.

While the application is automatically voice enabled by the HMT-1, WearML can be used to provide many improvements to the user experience without any code changes.
