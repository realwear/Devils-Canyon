<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Devil's Canyon is a simple application that is used to show how WearML can be used to optimize an Android App for a HMT-1 device.</p>

<p>The application consists of a single screen containing 3 logos showing some delicious beers. Selecting each logo will show a short description about each beer.</p>

<p>While the application is automatically voice enabled by the HMT-1, WearML can be used to provide many improvements to the user experience without any code changes.</p>
